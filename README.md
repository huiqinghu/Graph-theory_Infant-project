# Graph-theory_Infant-project
This code is for calculating small-world propensity, clustering coefficient, path length and nodal efficiency in neonates.
Data analysis was performed using MatlabR2020b with the following packages: the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) and SWP (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dsb/).

For adults, two parameters need to be changed: 1) timeseries_nos = [871]; 2) nroi = [217].
